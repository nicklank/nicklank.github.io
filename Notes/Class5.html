cascades
1 POSITION AND ORDER OF APPEARANCE
--reads linearly from top to bottom, something below 
updates the previous information to be most recent
possible to link multiple style sheets

2 SPECIFICITY - which css selector most important??
more specific rules will take precedent
ie. element < class < id
element least spec, id most

class has weight 10

paragraph would make it 11


weight elementn 1
class 10
id 100 

example

p{


}
