    <h2>
        Why Make Your Own Perfume?
    </h2>

    <p>
        Modern perfumes can cost a lot of money, sometimes up to $300 or more for a 100ml bottle.
        Due to a growing online community, the information for making your own perfume is now available for free.
        It is a fun hobby to engage in and create things that smell amazing. One interesting part of fragrance making is that it's one of the only activities where you are using the sole sense of smell, rather than a combination of smell with other senses. 
        It's also a good way to use a little math and learn a little about chemistry in your daily life. Fragrance as a hobby also presents itself in daily life, as you may pass someone on the street and try to identify what molecules or ingredients where in their fragrance.

    <h2>
        What Are The Parts Of A Fragrance?
    </h2>

    <p>
        It is generally accepted that fragrances have a top note, mid note, and bass note.<br>
        <strong>Top notes</strong> are the part of your fragrance that last the least amount of time (about 15-30 minutes), but are generally the strongest right when the fragrance is applied.
        Some common top notes would be citrus, floral, and fruits such as lemon, bergamot, and grapefruit.
        <br>
        <strong>Mid notes</strong>, also known as heart notes, can last from about 30 minutes up 4 hours. The mid and heart notes are often the most complex notes in a fragrance and provide the most character. 
        Common mid notes could be floral, such as jasmine, rose, or geranium, fruity notes like apple, pineapple, blackcurrant, or spicy notes like clove, nutmeg, or cinnamon.
        <br>
        Finally, there's the <strong>Base notes</strong>, or "dry down", which last the longest, generally 4-6 hours or even longer. <br>
        Examples would be patchouil, oakmoss, sandalwood, oud, musk, cedar, and amber, just to name a few.

    <h2>
        Procss Overview
    </h2>

    <p>
        The process of making your own fragrance at home can be daunting at first.<br>
        It is highly recomended to have the followuing equipment:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Milligram scale</li>
        <li>Pipettes</li>
        <li>Test strips</li>
        <li>Small air-tight containers (~10-20ml)</li>
        <li>Paper towels</li>
        <li>Perfumers Alcohol (or denatured alcohol, or 190 proof alcohol)</li>
        <li>Raw Materials</li>

    </ol>

    <p>
        Now that you have all the recomended equipment, you're ready to start your scent journey.<br>
        Most raw materials are diluted down to a 10% solution in alcahol/ethanol before they are smelled. <br>
        This is done because raw materials come very potent, and can even be dangerous at this potentcy. <br>
        You would create the 10% solution by weighing one part of the raw material, and multiplying that weight by 9, to get the other 9 parts of the whole 10 parts in the solution. <br><br>
        Ex. 0.5g Bergamot, (.5 x 9 = 4.5). 4.5g Ethanol <br><br>

        Now that you have all of your raw materials down to the correct concentration level, you can go ahead and use the test strips to smell these.<br>
        I would recommend smelling all the scents first, then deciding which you think would smell good together by holding the scent strips close together and smelling.<br>
        From here you can use your 10% dilutions to create mock ups of the smell.
