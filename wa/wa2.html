<h3>Class Goal: to learn more about making websites and to apply what I'm learning in this class to my personal life tracking web-app project.</h3>
<p>I'm originally from Atlanta, GA and I study Environmental Product Design with a CTD minor. <br> I am very passionate about design and ways that it can make the world a better place.
    <br> Specifically' I'm very interested in sustainability, fashion, technology, product design, homegoods, and more.
